This project is about to guess the missing letters in the displayed word. I am doing this as my first project to learn software web development. This short brief will highlight what this software will do. 

1.	It will display a word, and ask the user to input the missing letters
2.	Then click the “check” button, to see what letters you entered. You are allowed to enter only one letter at a time. 
3.	Click the “check validity”, to see if your guess is correct or not. 


Note: as of now, I am unable to reset the user input after guessing the letters for the displayed word. I am refreshing the whole page to try the other words. As I go on, I will work on the “Reset” button, so I will be able to track each player points and decide which the winner is,
For now this project is checking if the user guess is correct or not.
